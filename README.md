# spaceBear_weather_search
This is a weather search app that allows you to type in a city name and return the temperature (F), conditions, windspeed(mph), Sunrise Time, and Sunset Time. This is very much my first attempt at working with API's, so any feedback would be greatly appreciate!  Much love!
